Show Backlog
===============


This is a simple, tiny app that shows a backlog creates by [gissues](http://gissues.com/) publicly.


[Gissues](http://gissues.com/) is a neat little JavaScript App that enables you to organize your github issues in a prioritized backlog.
It stores the priorization information as JSON bites in the body of the issues. This app retrieves the issues from the github api and shows them in the order given by gissues. Nothing more.

Deployed on Heroku - to see all Issues of your repo, open this url in your browser:

    http://showbacklog.herokuapp.com/<owner>/<repository>

e.g. [http://showbacklog.herokuapp.com/bkleinen/showbacklog](http://showbacklog.herokuapp.com/bkleinen/showbacklog) for this project's backlog.
